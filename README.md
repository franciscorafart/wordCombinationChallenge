# Word Combination Challenge
A word combination challenge for a job application. Here are the instructions:

You're given a vector of vectors of words, e.g.:
[['quick', 'lazy'], ['brown', 'black', 'grey'], ['fox', 'dog']].

Write a generalized function that prints all combinations of one word from the first vector, one word from the second vector, etc.
The solution may not use recursion.
NOTE: the number of vectors and number of elements within each vector may vary.

For the input above, it should print (in any order):
quick brown fox
quick brown dog
quick black fox
quick black dog
...
lazy grey dog
